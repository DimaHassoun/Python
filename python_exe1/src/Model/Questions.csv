8,"In MVC, the component responsible for handling user actions?",2,Model,View,Controller,Database,C
9,Which architectural style organizes the system into hierarchical?,2,Client-Server,Layered Architecture,Black-Box Architecture,Spiral Architecture,B
10,What is a ?goal? in non-functional requirements?,2,A general intention of the user,A precise testable constraint,A documented error,A formal specification,A
11,What is the main disadvantage of incremental development?,3,No user feedback,System structure may degrade without refactoring,Cannot be used for large systems,Too much documentation is required,B
12,Which requirement property checks whether the requirement can actually be tested?,3,Consistency,Adaptability,Verifiability,Completeness,C
